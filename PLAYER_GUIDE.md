## Playthrough

There are three levels for the player to complete. The first two levels, Home and ClockLand, consists of puzzles that the player must solve and reach the end of the level to advance to the next level. The last level, Sky Island, is a boss level where the player needs to kill the boss to complete the game.

### Home

The player is located in a large house with various rooms and obstacles. Use your hammer (E) to break certain obstacles and escape.

### ClockLand

ClockLand consists of a giant clock in the sky and dangerous objects. The player can use backtrace (E) to go back where they were three seconds ago to dodge objects or solve time-sensitive puzzles.

### Sky Island

Face the boss and attempt to kill it while dodging attacks. 

The boss has two attacks, Rock Throw and Ring Wave. Rock Throw throws blue gems at the player, which damage the player upon impact. This attack can also destroy the white core crystal that is located on the map. Destroying this crystal will damage the boss. Ring Wave throws multiple walls of green gems at the player, which damage the player upon impact.

The player can use their special movement abilities, Glide and Jet, to dodge incoming attacks. In addition, the player has a passive that heals the player to full health if they haven't been in combat for seven seconds.
